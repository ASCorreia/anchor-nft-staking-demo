This is a simple implementation of an NFT staking program on Solana that you can use for educational purposes.

Note that a more robust implementation should be used for production. DO NOT DEPLOY THIS ON MAINNET.

Things you could add:
1. Constrain it to only work with a single collection - right now you can stake any NFT
2. Freeze the NFT rather than transfer it - custodial NFT staking is a somewhat outdated pattern
3. Add an actual reward token rather than "points"
4. Make a more robust test suite

And so much more...
